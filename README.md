This is a Project which I coded by watching the Youtube Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKdQjQX1Pko for learning purpose about APIs

This project uses Google Maps Javascript API, Places API, OpenWeather API, TravelAdvisor API

This Web app gives you info about all Restarurants, Hotels, and attractions anywhere in the World



Project status: Incomplete

Tech Used:
-Javascript
-React framework latest version which was available at 20 Oct 2021
-npm package installer

APIs used:
Travel Advisor API (Rapid API)
Google Maps Javascript API
Google places API
Open Weather API (Rapid API)


Difficulties Faced:
-Google's APIs worked for some time and then suddenly stopped working, and asks for "Billing must be enabled" to use the API further.Free trial
 also available, it asks to create a billing account to manage that project, but asks for credit card number to enter. So Google Maps API doesn't
 works.And so the other react components which depends upon the API also doesn't work.
